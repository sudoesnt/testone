## Overview
Briefly describe the purpose of the project and what problems it solves.

## Website
Static pages describing "Information About My House" are located in the `docs` folder. Open `index.html` in your browser to explore the rooms.

## Hosting the Website with GitHub Pages
To publish the site on GitHub Pages, push the branch containing the `docs` folder (for example `work`) to GitHub. Then open **Settings â†’ Pages** in the repository and choose that branch with the `/docs` folder as the source. The branch used for Pages can be different from your repository's default branch (often `master`).
